## Instructions

You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with your trip planning, you need to do some climate analysis on the area. The following sections outline the steps you must take to accomplish this task.

#### Part 1: Climate Analysis and Exploration

##### Precipitation Analysis

##### Station Analysis

#### Part 2: Design Your Climate App

Now that you have completed your initial analysis, you’ll design a Flask API based on the queries that you have just developed.

Use Flask to create your routes, as follows:


##### Temperature Analysis 1

Conduct an analysis to answer the following question: Hawaii is reputed to enjoy mild weather all year round. Is there a meaningful difference between the temperatures in, for example, June and December?

##### Temperature Analysis 2

You want to take a trip from August 1 to August 7 of this year, but you are worried that the weather will be less than ideal. Using historical data in the dataset, find out what the temperature has previously been for this timeframe.

##### Daily Rainfall Average

Now that you have an idea of the temperature, let’s find out what the rainfall has been. You don't want to visit if it rains the whole time! Complete the following steps:

* Calculate the rainfall per weather station using the previous year's matching dates.

    * Sort this in descending order by precipitation amount, and list the station, name, latitude, longitude, and elevation.

#### Daily Temperature Normals

Calculate the daily normals for the duration of your trip. Normals are the averages for the minimum, average, and maximum temperatures.
